By default Ubuntu will use the open source video driver Nouveau for your NVIDIA graphics card. This driver lacks support for 3D acceleration and may not work with the very latest video cards or technologies from NVIDIA.

An alternative to Nouveau are the closed source unified NVIDIA drivers, which are developed by NVIDIA. This driver provides excellent 3D acceleration and video card support.

There is no uninstaller for MATLAB on UNIX or Linux. To remove MATLAB you simply need to delete the MATLAB installation following the instructions below:

1. If you are running a license manager for MATLAB, shut down the license manager using the 'lmdown' script located in MATLAB's etc directory. If this folder does not exist, you are not running the FlexNet license manager. For example:

 [root@localhost ~] /usr/local/MATLAB/R2010b/etc/lmdown

2. You should also remove any license manager files in the /var/tmp directory. These files should begin with 'lm_TMW', ex:

 [root@localhost ~] rm /var/tmp/lm_TMW*

3. Remove the entire root MATLAB directory using the 'rm -rf' command, ex:

 [root@localhost ~] rm -rf /usr/local/MATLAB/R2010b

4. Remove any symlinks to MATLAB binaries on the path, ex:
 [root@localhost ~] rm /usr/local/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/mcc /usr/local/bin/mex /usr/local/bin/mbuild
